The Seattle AirBnB homes data set used for this analysis can be found at the link: [Seattle AirBNB Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)

For this project I was curious to find the price trends and best neighbourhood to stay based on reviews and cost.

Questions tried to answer:
1. Are there any tend in pricing of house listings?
2. Can you describe which part of Seattle neighborhood has highest review score rating using listing descriptions?
3. Which are the top 5 costliest and cheapest Seattle neighboorhood?
